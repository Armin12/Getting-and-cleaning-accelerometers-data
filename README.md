**Getting and Cleaning Accelerometers Data**
The collected data from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone are provided. We follow the steps below to get and clean the dataset by creating the R script run_analysis.R:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The "AVE_ACTIVITY_SUBJECT_DF.txt" is the output of this step.

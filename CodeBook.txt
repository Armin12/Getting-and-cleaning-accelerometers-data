==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Training data ("X_train") and their labels ("y_train"), test data ("X_test") and their labels ("y_test") were read from .txt files with the same names.

Function, called "cleaner", converts a single row of X (e.g. "X_train" or "X_test") into a character class. It then replaces double spaces "  " with single space " " to make a more uniform data. Then it splits the text (character data) by the space between the values. At the end the obtained characters are transformed into numeric values. The first value is NA which is not part of the extracted data. So, it is removed by taking [2:562] which is 561 feature in total. The above cleaner function was applied to every row in the "X_train" and "X_test" and the result was transformed into a matrix with every column represent a feature (variable) and every row was a sample (data point).

"Xtrain": matrix representation of "X_train"
"Xtest": matrix representation of "X_test"

"X_train" and "X_test" were concatenated into "DATA" 
"y_train" and "y_test" were concatenated into "LABELS"

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

The "features.txt" was read and saved into "feature" data frame. It includes names of all the features with its number at the begining.

"FEATURES": transformed "features" into character 

"meanstdfeatures": index of features with the measurements on the mean and standard deviation are selected. It searches through "FEATURES" to find those with one of mean, Mean, std, or Std in their names. Features whose index are presented in the "meanstdfeatures" are extracted. Then, part of the "DATA" corresponding to those features were extracted.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

File "activity_labels.txt" was read and saved in "activity_labels" variable.

"ACTIVITY_LABELS": character form of "activity_labels" with the number at their begining is removed using gsub function.

Function called "namer", takes a label of an activity in the "LABEL" variable and gives its corresponding name. This function was applied to all the recordings (samples) and was saved in  "NAME_LABEL". So, "NAME_LABEL" is the same as "LABEL" but with labels presented as names instead of numbers labeling.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

"DATA_FRAME": the data frame representation of "DATA"

The names given to the columns of this data frame are the same as "FEATURES" but with the numbers at their begining has been removed.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The subject data were read and saved in "subject_train" and "subject_test"

"subject_train" and "subject_test" were Concatenated into "subject" and were transformed into character class.

"AVE_ACTIVITY_SUBJECT" is a tidy data set matrix with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

"AVE_ACTIVITY_SUBJECT_DF" is the data frame representation of "AVE_ACTIVITY_SUBJECT" with specified names
